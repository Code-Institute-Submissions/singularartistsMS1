# Singular Artists Company Website

## Code Institute MS1 Project: User-Centric Frontend Development

A website created to showcase Irish promoter Singular Artists' work in the Event industry. The website highlights various clients the company are representing and their wealth of experience in the industry. 

The site features an about page, a page listing all clients represented, an events listing page and a contact page. There is also a social media plugin to display active promotion to users. 

The primary goal of the website is to inform and direct users to the contact page. As a B2B website, the aim is to convey credibility and assurance to the user. The website layout and navigation structure will guide the user to company information and clientlist highlighting it's reliability and expertise. These pages along with the CTA's and live chat popups will lead the user towards the contact page.  

**The business goals of this website are:**

- To inform users about the exciting client base.

### EDIT EDIT This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.EDIT EDIT ###

### Strategy

My strategy for the site was to provide reputable content and ease of access to users trying to attain information by utilising key UX principals.
I wanted to incorporate the majority of elements from [Peter Morville's UX Honeycomb](https://books.google.ie/books?id=yLd9DwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA6&dq=ux%20honeycomb%20peter%20morville&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q=ux%20honeycomb%20peter%20morville&f=false) to create a great experience for the user. In particular, I believed that the aspects of "Credible", "Valuable" and "Usable" were highly significant to implement in this project. I felt that the owner images and client list would add to the credibility of the company and the overall site.   

#### Ideal users of this website:
- Artists/Bands/Agents
- Venue Managers
- Ticketing Providers

#### These users are looking for:
- An experienced, credible promoter to work with
- Evidence of promotional work

#### This project is the best way to achieve their goals because:
- Most promoter websites increase the cognitive load on the user. This website enables effortless navigation through the pages building assurance and directing the user towards the contact elements.

### Scope
To achieve the strategy goals, I wanted to include the following features in this production release:
- Carousel - Using emotive imagery of live gigs to signify popularity and successful events. The larger the crowd displayed in the imagery, the greater the indication of high revenue/success for potential clients.
- Embed social media feeds & Spotify playlist - Showcase promotional activity and create buzz for clientbase.

Due to time restraints I was unable to include the following but hope to implement the following features in a future release:
- Blog - To provide updates of upcoming events, and artists' news.
- Live Chat app - To provide instant connection between the user and company with visibility on each page.  

### Structure 

I decided to create a five page website incorporating only the necessary actions and info required by the ideal users to reduce cognitive overload. 
The navigation bar would include the links to all four pages on the right and the company logo/home link placed on the left to follow industry standard and create familiarity with the user. 
This allows the user to easily learn and understand the structure and effortlessly navigate through the site when using it for the first time. 
I decided that the links would also be strategically placed in the intended journey the user should follow. i.e. Home->About->Artists->Events->Contact. This would allow the user to learn about the experience promoter, their credibility in the industry with the artists they represent, the large number of events presented gaining the trust of the user propelling them towards the contact page. 
 
### Skeleton
- [Wireframes](/assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf "Homepage Wireframe"): Website contains 5 pages; Home, About, Artists, Events and a Contact Page.
- Fixed navigation bar and footer. Nav bar contains links pointing to each individual page and the footer contains contact info and Social Media icons. 

### Surface 

The company logo incorporates the vibrant dual colours of white and bright pink. 
The promoters selected the striking colours to convey a sense of confidence and excitement as a reflection of their industry.
I wanted the brand colours to feature as the accent colours in the CTA's to connect the brand with the actions taken by the user. To allow the CTA's and brand colours to stand out and gain the attention of the user, I wanted to keep the rest of the site monochrome with a white background and black and grey text. This also allows the website to appear less cluttered and minimalistic adding to the overall UX. This color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel in keeping with the brand.

 typography and design elements will be used?

 Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap CHECK VERSION

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
